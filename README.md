# Penmanshiel · live turbine anomaly monitor · Omega × NVIDIA Nemotron

Fork of [`archetypeai-wind-turbine-demo`](https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-wind-turbine-demo) that adds **NVIDIA Nemotron fault briefs** (with a toggle to compare against Newton C 2.6). Newton Omega + local KNN still decide healthy / fault; when a turbine is committed to `fault`, Nemotron (NVIDIA hosted API, default `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`) gets the flagged window's SCADA statistics next to the healthy peer's over the same hours and returns a short brief — what changed, the likely cause, what to check — shown under the fault entry in the anomaly feed. See [NVIDIA Nemotron fault briefs](#nvidia-nemotron-fault-briefs).

A side-by-side live demo of [Archetype AI's Newton](https://www.archetypeai.io/) **Direct Query API** classifying real wind-turbine SCADA telemetry. Three months of data from the Penmanshiel wind farm are replayed at hourly cadence in the browser; each ~21-hour window is embedded by the Omega encoder (one `/query` per channel) and scored by a **local KNN** against an n-shot library of `healthy` / `fault` reference windows — no lens, no session, no SSE plumbing. The verdicts drive the per-turbine state, the anomaly feed, and the SVG blade colours in real time.

**All classification — every state badge, every anomaly feed entry, every blade colour — comes from Newton.** There is no local heuristic; the Flask backend is a thin replay-streamer plus a background Direct-Query classifier (built on the official `archetypeai` Python client). The only other model writes the fault briefs and never changes a verdict: NVIDIA Nemotron by default, or Newton C 2.6 via the feed's toggle.

The dataset features a documented frequency-converter outage on **WT01** in early November 2019. Its healthy peer **WT09** runs the same hardware on the same hill in the same minute-by-minute wind. The demo invites you to watch Newton find the difference.

## What the app does

- **Replays** 2,184 hourly SCADA ticks (2019-09-01 → 2019-12-01) for WT01 + WT09 over an SSE stream, driven by a **Start / Stop** control.
- **Classifies each 128-sample (~21 h) window via Direct Query** — the four signal channels are embedded by the Omega encoder (one `/query` per channel, fanned out in parallel) and scored by a local KNN against the n-shot library (see [Architecture](#architecture-direct-query--local-knn)).
- **Runs the classifier in a background thread** and drains `newton_prediction` verdicts onto the SSE stream (~50 windows per turbine), paced to the replay timeline so a verdict surfaces as the playhead reaches its window.
- **Emits debounced anomaly events** on strong-majority verdict transitions (`fault` ↔ `healthy`) — see [Anomaly logic](#anomaly-logic) for the why.
- **Renders the dashboard** in the Archetype AI design system (Geist sans + Geist Mono, OKLCH palette, 2 px radii, FlatLogItem-style feed). Following [`agent-skills/DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/archetypeai/agent-skills/blob/main/DESIGN.md) — see [`templates/index.html`](templates/index.html) and [`static/style.css`](static/style.css).

## Dataset

Loaded from `./data/`. The full Penmanshiel release (~2 GB, not committed) is published by Cubico Sustainable Investments on Zenodo via Greenbyte — 14 turbines on the Scottish-Borders site, 2019 calendar-year SCADA at 10-minute cadence, status logs, grid-meter time-series, and PMU readings.

The demo needs (all in the WT01–10 SCADA zip):
- `data/Penmanshiel_WT_static.csv` — turbine metadata (Senvion MM82, 2,050 kW rated, 82 m rotor)
- **WT01 + WT09** full-year 10-minute SCADA — the two turbines replayed live
- **WT05 + WT06** full-year 10-minute SCADA — the n-shot reference turbines (fault outage / autumn-healthy)

The replay window (Sept 1 → Dec 1, ~13 k rows per turbine) is a slice of those CSVs. The n-shot references are **leakage-free** — they share no turbine-and-time with what we classify, so WT01's November fault is genuinely *unseen* (`_build_library()` asserts this before building):

| Class | Source | Window | Why disjoint from the live data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `healthy` | WT09 | 2019-07-01 → 2019-07-22 | summer — a different time than the live window |
| `healthy` | WT06 | 2019-10-01 → 2019-10-22 | a different turbine (autumn baseline → matches the live season) |
| `fault` | WT05 | 2019-03-08 06:00 → 03-10 00:00 | a different turbine's sustained ~36 h frequency-converter outage |

Per the [`atai-newton-omega-model`](https://github.com/archetypeai/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/atai-newton-omega-model) skill, every window is z-scored per channel with a global scaler fit on the reference pool and embedded with `normalize_input: false` (preserving cross-window amplitude). Healthy windows are capped to balance the KNN vote against the fewer fault windows. **Why cross-turbine for `fault`:** WT01's only 2019 fault is the November event we replay — using it as the reference would be leakage, so the fault class is learned from WT05's *same-type* outage instead, and detecting WT01's is genuine generalization.

### Fetching the data

The dataset lives on Zenodo — either [record 16807304](https://zenodo.org/records/16807304) (newer; also mirrored on [HLRS WindLab](https://windlab.hlrs.de/dataset/zenodo-16807304/resource/b16ea689-f8ca-4873-bf19-81110daf191c)) or [record 5946808](https://zenodo.org/records/5946808) (the original release). Both contain the same WT01–15 Penmanshiel SCADA at 10-minute cadence; the filenames and directory layout below are identical between the two — substitute either record number into the URLs. License: CC-BY-4.0.

You need **two files** for this demo — the SCADA zip that contains WT01 and WT09, plus the static metadata:

```bash
mkdir -p data && cd data

# WT01-10 2019 SCADA (~470 MB zipped, ~1.4 GB extracted; includes WT01 + WT09)
wget https://zenodo.org/api/records/16807304/files/Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112.zip/content \
    -O Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112.zip
# The zip has no top-level folder — extract into the one data_loader expects.
unzip Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112.zip -d Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112
rm Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112.zip

# Static metadata (rated power, hub height, lat/long, etc.)
wget https://zenodo.org/api/records/16807304/files/Penmanshiel_WT_static.csv/content \
    -O Penmanshiel_WT_static.csv

cd ..
```

After extraction your `data/` directory should look like:

```
data/
├── Penmanshiel_WT_static.csv
└── Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT01-10_3112/
    ├── Turbine_Data_Penmanshiel_01_2019-01-01_-_2020-01-01_1042.csv  # WT01 (faulty)
    ├── Turbine_Data_Penmanshiel_09_2019-01-01_-_2020-01-01_1049.csv  # WT09 (healthy peer)
    ├── Turbine_Data_Penmanshiel_02_2019-01-01_-_2020-01-01_1043.csv
    ├── Status_Penmanshiel_01_…csv
    └── … (other turbines and status logs, not used by the demo)
```

At runtime the demo reads only the **WT01** and **WT09** turbine-data CSVs plus the static metadata. The **WT05** and **WT06** CSVs are read once by `build_library.py` to embed the n-shot reference windows (all four turbines are in the same WT01–10 zip). The remaining files in the zip (WT02, WT04, WT07, WT08, WT10, status logs) are harmless extras — `data_loader.discover_turbines()` enumerates whatever is present.

**Optional extras**, not needed for the demo:
- `Penmanshiel_SCADA_2019_WT11-15_3117.zip` — WT11–15 2019 SCADA.
- `Penmanshiel_WT_dataSignalMapping.xlsx` — column-name reference for the SCADA exports.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+ (Archetype AI SDK needs ≥ 3.10), Archetype AI API credentials, an NVIDIA API key for the briefs (optional — create one at https://build.nvidia.com/settings/api-keys), and the Penmanshiel dataset.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/archetypeai/archetypeai-wind-turbine-demo-nemotron.git
cd archetypeai-wind-turbine-demo-nemotron

# Fetch the dataset (see above) into ./data/

# Credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ATAI_API_KEY, ATAI_API_ENDPOINT and NVIDIA_API_KEY (nvapi-…, build.nvidia.com)
# Optional: NEMOTRON_MODEL (default nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b)

# Virtual env
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Precompute the n-shot reference library once (writes library.json)
.venv/bin/python build_library.py

# Run
.venv/bin/python app.py
open http://127.0.0.1:5050/
```

`build_library.py` embeds the static reference windows offline and saves them to
`library.json`, so the app loads them instantly at runtime instead of re-embedding
on every cold start. If `library.json` is missing (or you change a reference window /
window size / model), the app rebuilds it live on the first **Start** — and you can
re-run `build_library.py` to refresh the file. With the library precomputed, runtime
only needs the **WT01 + WT09** data; the reference turbines (WT05, WT06) are only read
when building the library.

Press **Start** to begin the replay (and **Stop** to end it). The library load is
near-instant, so classification begins right away.

## Using the UI

- **Top bar**: Archetype AI wordmark · title · live `Building reference library…` / `Newton analysing` / `Newton complete` status pill · connection-state dot (`idle` → `streaming` → `ready`) · **Start / Stop** button.
- **Timeline strip**: simulated date range with a cursor that advances per tick; `t-now` mono readout on the right.
- **Per-turbine panel** (left and right of the feed):
  - `ANALYSING` / `HEALTHY` / `FAULT` state badge (driven by Newton's *debounced* state).
  - `NEWTON {class} {H/F · X/Y}` verdict badge — updates the vote counter on every prediction, but the colour/pulse only flips on strong-majority verdicts (filters out close 3-2 KNN ties).
  - Animated SVG turbine — rotor spin tracks measured RPM; blade colour mirrors the panel state.
  - Numeric stat row (Power / Wind / Rotor RPM / Pitch / Gear oil) in mono with current-window values.
  - Rolling 96-tick power + wind sparkline.
- **Anomaly feed** (centre column): strong-majority state transitions ("Detected: fault classification", "Recovered: now healthy") with the window range and timestamp. Single 3-2 KNN flickers are intentionally suppressed.
  - Each fault entry gets a **fault brief** — "Analysing window vs. healthy peer…" while it runs, then the observation, likely cause and 2–3 checks.
  - **Nemotron / Newton C** toggle in the feed header picks the model for the briefs (NVIDIA Nemotron by default). Switching re-briefs every fault already in the feed; each (model, window) pair is cached, so switching back is instant.

## Architecture: Direct Query + local KNN

There is **no lens and no session** in this demo. Each window is embedded with one stateless `POST /v0.5/query` call per channel against the Omega encoder, and classification is a plain k-nearest-neighbour vote against an in-memory reference library — entirely on our side. This is the [`atai-newton-omega-model`](https://github.com/archetypeai/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/atai-newton-omega-model) skill's recommended downstream pattern.

### How it works

1. **Build the library once, offline** (`build_library.py` → `save_library`). The curated reference windows (table above) are sliced, z-scored with a single global scaler fit on the reference pool, embedded channel-by-channel, and concatenated into one vector per window — then persisted to `library.json` with the scaler and a config fingerprint. Healthy windows are capped (`HEALTHY_CAP`) so the KNN vote isn't swamped by the larger healthy class. `_assert_disjoint()` runs first and raises if any reference window overlaps the live turbines/time — leakage fails loudly rather than silently inflating accuracy. At runtime `_build_library()` loads `library.json` instantly (no `/query` calls); if it's missing or the fingerprint changed, it rebuilds live. This is the [`atai-newton-omega-model-data-prep`](https://github.com/archetypeai/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/atai-newton-omega-model-data-prep) offline/runtime split.
2. **Classify in the background** (`BackgroundClassifier`). A worker thread walks both live turbines' replay windows, embeds each the same way, runs `_knn(vec, library, k=KNN_K)`, and pushes `newton_prediction` events (with `class`, `votes`, and a `tick_index` mapping the window onto the replay timeline) onto a queue. `app.py` drains that queue and *releases* each prediction when the visible timeline reaches its `tick_index`, so predictions stay aligned with the scrubbing playhead.
3. **Per-channel fan-out with retries** (`_embed_window`). The four channels for a window are embedded concurrently through a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`OMEGA_MAX_CONCURRENCY`), each call retried up to `OMEGA_RETRIES` times — the same bounded-concurrency `embed()` shape the skill uses.

All of this lives in [`newton_client.py`](newton_client.py); the official [`archetypeai`](https://pypi.org/project/archetypeai/) Python client makes the `/query` calls via `client.requests_post`.

## NVIDIA Nemotron fault briefs

For every non-silent anomaly whose new state is `fault`, the browser calls `POST /api/brief` with the turbine, window and KNN votes plus the model selected in the feed's toggle — `nemotron` (default) or `newton` (Newton C 2.6). The replay stream never waits on it. `app.py` caches each brief per (model, turbine, window). `nemotron_client.py`:

1. **Summarises both turbines over the flagged window** at 10-minute cadence — mean / min / max for wind, power, rotor RPM, pitch, gear-oil and generator-bearing temperature, grid frequency — plus hours with wind above cut-in (4 m/s) and hours *stopped in wind* (power ≤ 10 kW above cut-in).
2. **Calls the selected model** with the same prompt, asking for JSON: `observation`, `likely_cause`, `checks[]`.
   - **Nemotron:** `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions`, reasoning off (`chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}`).
   - **Newton C 2.6:** `Newton::c2_6_8b_fp8_260424d7a55d5e` on Archetype's `/query`, with the prompt in `instruction_prompt`.
   - Measured on WT01's Nov 4 window: Nemotron ~1.5 s, Newton C 2.6 ~2–5 s; both cite feathered pitch and a stopped rotor against WT09.
3. **Validates** the reply has all three fields before it reaches the UI; on failure the endpoint returns an error and the row says the model was unavailable for that window.

Neither model sees the turbine status logs, so the cause named is inferred from SCADA alone and is framed as a hypothesis for the operator. Without `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in `.env`, Nemotron briefs show as unavailable; switch the toggle to Newton C, which uses the Archetype key the demo already needs.

## Anomaly logic

KNN on a small n-shot library returns the occasional split (4-1, 3-2) vote on borderline windows. The demo treats a verdict as **strong** only when the winning class leads the runner-up by ≥ `STRONG_MARGIN` votes (with `k=5`: 5-0 or 4-1 qualify; 3-2 doesn't). `app.py:_anomaly_from` commits a state change — and fires an anomaly entry — only on the first strong verdict in a new direction; weak verdicts update the vote counter but don't flip the panel. The per-panel verdict badge surfaces the raw votes so users can see *why* each decision fired.

Validated on held-out windows (none in the library): WT01's November fault is detected as it develops — the onset window still reads healthy, then flips to fault.

The "healthy" peer isn't fault-free either: the replay also flags **WT09 on 2019-10-17 → 10-19**. That's a real event, not a false positive — WT09's status log records a ~23 h stop starting 2019-10-17 13:29 (*Charging circuit pitch*, with battery charge-cycle errors on all three pitch axes). The Nemotron brief for that window, written from SCADA alone, points to a pitch-system fault.

## API surface

| Endpoint | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | The dashboard UI |
| `GET /api/scada/<wt_id>` | Downsampled 3-month SCADA series for a single turbine (JSON, debug aid) |
| `GET /api/replay?tps=N` | SSE stream: `meta`, `newton_status`, `tick`, `newton_prediction`, `anomaly` (with `votes`), `complete` |
| `POST /api/brief` | Fault brief for one window: `{turbine, window_start, window_end, votes, model: "nemotron" \| "newton"}` → `{observation, likely_cause, checks, model, cached}` |

`tps` (ticks/sec) clamps to `[1, 200]`; the replay duration scales linearly with it. The UI requests a fixed `tps=15` (the Start button) for a steady ~2.5-minute replay, but the endpoint accepts any value. The background classifier runs ahead of the playhead; `app.py` buffers its predictions and releases each one as the visible timeline reaches its `tick_index`, so predictions stay aligned with playback at any speed.

## Lessons learned

- **Leakage discipline drives accuracy, not model tuning.** The first build classified almost everything backwards because the fault reference (WT05, Mar 7–17) was mostly *non-fault* hours and the only healthy reference was summer-only — so the KNN keyed on season and turbine identity, not on fault. Tightening the fault reference to WT05's sustained ~36 h outage, adding an autumn healthy baseline (WT06 Oct) to match the live season, and capping the healthy class fixed it. `_assert_disjoint()` enforces the rule in code.
- **No lens, no session — Direct Query is simpler and stateless.** Embedding each window with `POST /v0.5/query` and running KNN locally removes the entire lens-runner orchestration (sessions, runner quotas, push pacing, orphan cleanup) that the earlier lens-based build wrestled with. See the [`atai-newton-omega-model`](https://github.com/archetypeai/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/atai-newton-omega-model) skill.
- **`normalize_input: false` + a fitted global scaler** preserves cross-window amplitude so a stopped turbine looks different from a running one — the skill's recommended downstream pattern.
